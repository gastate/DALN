Title: Who Needs Sleep When There Are So Many Books?
Description: This is just sort of a random sampling of some details about my growing up with books. To kind of tie up the loose end created by the title - I realized after listening to this that I didn't stop skipping out on sleep after Kindergarten. I use to stay up all night and skip school the next day just so I could finish reading my book. If my college classes didn't have such strict attendance policies, I would probably still be doing that regularly.....
